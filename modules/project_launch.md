## Launching a scientific software community

Community vs Open-source

## Finding early users

An important challenge that many scientific software projects face is the step from an internally developed to a widely available software. This transition can happen at different stages of a project, e.g. when a mature software project decides to switch to a community organization, after finalizing a Ph.D. project, or right-from-the-start when a researcher decides to develop a new software for the community. A common social problem at this stage is to acquire and hold a userbase, and many SSPs stay at a single contributor forever. This might be intentional though, so when releasing your software you should ask yourself what are realistic expectations for the community of this project, and who will be most interested?

*Exercise*: 
Write down the target audience of your project. Be specific (scientific discipline, career stage, application, skill level). How many people approximately fit into this target audience?

## Convincing your target audience

- Take it seriously
- Do not force the issue, understand their point of view
- Focus on a limited number of users
- Sell either a feature, or a vision
