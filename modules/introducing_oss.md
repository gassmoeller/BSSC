#### Reading: x min

#### Exercises: x min

#### Questions:
- What are the implications of using/developing open-source software for science?

- How (if at all) can I convince reluctant scientists to share their work with an open-source project?

#### Objectives:
- Understand the difference between a scientific tool and a scientific result
- Know about ways to provide credit for open-source software

- Learn about the changing landscape of OSS for science


## Why Open-source for science?

- increasingly required
- better cited
- less retracted

## But others could steal / wrongly apply / discredit my work?

- Address fears, but encourage heroism
- Emphasize individual responsibility

*Exercise*:
- Remember cases where closed software/data hindered your research

## Working in the open!

- Advertise your skills

## Software architecture and modularity to the rescue!

- Interfaces
- Modularity and plugins
- What should go in, what to keep separate
