#### Reading: x min

#### Exercises: x min

#### Questions:
- What are the implications of using/developing open-source software for science?
- Why are some scientists uncomfortable with open-source software?
- How (if at all) can I convince reluctant scientists to share their work with an open-source project?

#### Objectives:
- Understand the difference between a scientific tool and a scientific result
- Know about ways to provide credit for open-source software
- Learn how to allow public and private extension of software
- Learn about the changing landscape of OSS for science


## Why Open-source for science?

- increasingly required (link to funding agencies)
- better cited (find resources)
- less retracted (find reference)

## But others could steal / wrongly apply / discredit my work?

- Address fears, but encourage bravery
- Emphasize individual responsibility

*Exercise*:
- Remember cases where closed software/data hindered your research

## Working in the open!

- Advertise your skills
- Ways in which software work is credited
- When to open up?

## Software architecture and modularity to the rescue!

- Interfaces
- Modularity and plugins
- What should go in, what to keep separate
