# Managing changes in leadership, manage project forks, sunsetting projects

#### Questions:
- Do I want my project to continue even in case I have to step away from it?
- How should the new leadership role in our project be determined?

- Develop strategies to make leadership changes transparent
- Understand potential reasons for forks
- Consider the end-of-life for your project

## Project leadership
