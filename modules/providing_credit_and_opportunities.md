# Providing fair credit and growth opportunities for contributors

#### Questions:
- Why should I or others contribute work that is not immediately helpful for ourselves?
- How do I and other members of my community get credit for this work?
- How can I share the load of managing this software project? 

#### Objectives:
- Know the different types of credit work on a software projects can bring
- Assess the proportion of credit that is appropriate for the maintainers and for the other contributors of your project
- Understand growth strategies for members of your community, to increase the number of project maintainers, as well as contributors.


## The question of credit
- Credit is important as time spend on community and software is time not spent on science (unless working on the part of the software that produces the science).
- Since credit for software contributions is often less visible, people think they are less acknowledged.
- Many ways of credit: Perceived competence, Known as maintainer of ..., Create relations/Work in a great team, Feel useful
- Additionally, software work is increasingly acknowleged in science ('product'/'deliverables' instead of 'publications').

## The sharing of credit
- To give proper credit is an important motivation for contributions to software, however the type of credit can be different
- contributors/developers/maintainers can be used to give badges to people
- however, a lot of motivation simply comes from working in a good team and needing the software (Lakhani et al)

## The necessity of growth
- As a maintainer you need help when the project grows, a number of long-time contributors want recognition for what they have done ... solve both problems by making them maintainers
- Gradual growth is important
- Having clear policies for how to award badges is important
