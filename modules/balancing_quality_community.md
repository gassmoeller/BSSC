# Balancing software quality and community contributions

#### Questions:
- Why do I have to spend so much time on improving community contributions?
- Should I merge everything and fix it later?
- How much time do I need to spend on reviewing? 

#### Objectives:
- Understand the importance of community contributions
- Learn how to set contributors up for success
- Know the difference between 'doing it right the first time' and perfectionalism
- Document your expectations and guidelines


## I want my software to have a community, but their contributions are so bad
- Consider your first contributions, many of your contributors are scientists with little background in software engineering
- Do you give them all the tools? Provide guidelines
- Let them grow over time
- Offer more than coding (e.g. documentation, design)

## What should be merged?
- In general you want as many contributions as reasonable. If it was useful for one, it might be useful for others.
- Also consider that software is a tool, not an art! If it is functional and well designed, it does not need to be pretty (common pitfall for many maintainers who want their projects to be perfect)
- There are legitimate reasons when not to merge (see Kindly closing pull requests): If it is irrelevant, incompatible, untestable, or unresponsible to merge, do not merge it. 
- Problem in Science: Useful for one publication, but do not want to have it in the main software. If your software is modular there is the alternative of plugins that ship with publications.

## The art of code review in science
- Time intensive, but: Less bugs, but also better community connections (Bosu et al.)
- Apart from the technical benefits, they pose a social challenge: Different from journal peer review! More personal, more supportive, not anonymous.
- Learn about new applications, areas users are interested in.
- Becoming collaborators? Get a better impression of user's abilities.
