# Contributing to BSSC
BSSC is a community project that lives by the participation of its
members - including you! It is our goal to build an inclusive
and participatory community so we are happy that you are interested in
participating!

## Getting started with git and GitHub
BSSC is developed as an open-source project using git and GitHub.
If you are new to using git or the GitHub platform GitHub provides a helpful
guide on the process of contributing to an open-source project
[here](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

## Questions and suggestions about BSSC
For questions about BSSC, please use the 
[issue tracking system](https://github.com/gassmoeller/BSSW-community-guides/issues).

Please follow these simple instructions before opening a new discussion:
- Do a quick search in the list of open and closed issues for a duplicate of
  your issue.
- If you did not find an answer, open a new
  [issue](https://github.com/gassmoeller/BSSW-community-guides/issues/new) and explain your
  question in as much detail as necessary to understand your point.

## Making BSSC better
BSSC is intended as a community project, and we are accepting all kinds of
contributions. 

Obvious candidates are fixed typos or clarifications of confusing sentences,
but we also encourage design improvements, additions or rephrasing of paragraphs, 
or even the suggestion of new guides. Before you develop and suggest a bigger contribution, please
open a new [issue](https://github.com/geodynamics/aspect/issues/new) to discuss
your contribution with the community. This allows us to provide you with
some feedback, maybe this feature is already in development, or it exists already elsewhere.

To make a change to BSSC you should:
- Create a
[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) (through GitHub) of
the code base.
- Create a separate
[branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) (sometimes called a
feature branch) on which you do your modifications.
- You can propose that your branch be merged into the BSSC
code by opening a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
This will give others a chance to review your contribution.

## Acknowledgment of contributions
We are grateful for every contribution to BSSC, and there are several official
ways how your contribution will be acknowledged by the community:
- Every commit that was merged into the BSSC repository will make you part of
  the group of BSSC
  [contributors](https://github.com/gassmoeller/BSSW-community-guides/graphs/contributors).
- If you contributed significant functionality (usually defined as a contribution
  of at least a few paragraphs that contain at least one major content addition)
  we will ask you to add yourself to the list of BSSC authors of that particular
  topic.
- If you contributed significant functionality over an extended period of time
  (typically a few months) we are happy to welcome you to the group of BSSC
  maintainers. This role comes with the right to merge other contributors pull
  requests, and the responsibility to review them, before you do so :smile:.
  Please understand that this is an important function for the whole BSSC community
