These are questions that will be used during the creation of the tutorials. The answers of maintainers of successful scientific software projects will be included in the tutorials to collect hands-on knowledge from projects that have faced and overcome these challenges. If you are the maintainer of a scientific software project, it might help you to think about these questions.

## Questions:

0. (optional beginning) Please describe the nature of your software project. What is your type of project, do you develop application software or (generic or specific) libraries? How many users or developers are involved in your project? Who is your target user group?

1. (Project Activity) How active is the community in your software project? How many questions, comments, or contributions do you typically receive per week? How many new users or developers do you typically onboard per year?

2. (Types of Communication) Do your users/developers know or meet each other personally or does communication happen exclusively via email/github/forum? If they meet, do they meet as part of a user or developer meeting, or typically as one-to-one meetings at conferences? How would you describe the general tone of discussion?

3. (Code of Conduct and Atmosphere) Do you have an explicit or implicit code of conduct in your project? Was it ever necessary to enforce the code of conduct? Did you have users complaining about the community culture in your project? How did you address these complaints?

4. (Identifying obstacles to new users) What is a common objection from potential new users in your project? If users decided not to use your project did you get feedback on what reason brought them to withdraw? Did you make specific changes to adress these reasons? Are your new users comfortable with the level of openness that working with OSS brings with it?

5. (Planned project vs. chance) How did your project start and grow? Was it launched as part of a larger initiative or was it something that happened by chance? How did your project find its first users after launch? Did it grow steadily or were there sudden periods of growth?

6. (Conflict management) Are you aware of situations in which participants worked on identical, or conflicting features for your software? When were these conflicts discovered? Do you have a certain policy to deal with these conflicts? Do you decide based on time of submission, technical quality, or community status of the submitting member?

7. (Financing and Time Balance) How is the work of your core developers financed? Do you get grants specific for software development? Do developers need to finance their own time (e.g. by including time in their scientific proposals)? Do developers generally only work on topics they are personally invested in, or is there true community work happening? How much of it? Are there developers working exclusively on your software, or is it always connected and justified by science questions?

8. (Credit and Growth) How do contributions to your project get acknowledged? Is there a process for giving credit or even authorship to new contributors? Are these rules explicitly stated? Are these rules publicly available or only known for experienced contributors?

9. (Competing and Upstream Project Relations, this questions is sensitive, answering is optional, and you do not need to provide names)
  * Does your project depend on scientific upstream packages (not general-purpose like MPI)? Is there communication between your project and the upstream projectes? Do you provide upstream improvements? 
  * Are there competing software projects to yours with similar scope? Is there regular communication between your project and the competing projects? How would you describe the atmosphere between your projects? Competitive? Collegial? Friendly?

10. (Rotating leadership) Is your project still primarily lead by the founder of the project? If so, what will likely happen if the founder had to retire from the project? Is there a plan for the transition of leadership? If not, did the transition occur smoothly? Which circumstances and decision were helpful in the process? Were there mistakes that you would want to avoid next time? 

11. (Project forks) Was your project ever in danger of splitting into several forks? How did the situation play out? Would you in retrospect say it was the right decision? Could/Should it have been prevented? Where there any concrete changes you implemented in your community as result of this experience?
