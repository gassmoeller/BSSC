# Community Guides for Scientific Software Development (CCSSD?)

As a maintainer of and contributor to scientific software, I have experienced that many scientific software projects readily employ state-of-the-art technical best practices but struggle to create and maintain an active and welcoming community around their software. As a BSSw Fellow, I will develop a tutorial series that discusses the typical social challenges that arise during the evolution of a scientific software project.  Aimed at current and prospective software maintainers and community leaders, the tutorials will discuss topics such as building a welcoming community atmosphere, overcoming skepticism of sharing science and software, mediating between users working on conflicting topics or publications, and providing credit and growth opportunities for contributors.


## Possible subtopics

* Engaging scientific users at project launch,
* Integrating scientists uncomfortable with open-source software,
* Combining high software quality with a welcoming atmosphere for diverse
  contributors,
* Mediating between users working on conflicting features or overlapping
  publications,
* Balancing community and architecture work with scientific research,
* Managing relations with competing projects,
* Providing fair credit and growth opportunities for contributors.
