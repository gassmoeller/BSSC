# Better Scientific Software Communities (BSSC)

## What is BSSC?

BSSC is a series of guides / tutorial modules that are developed with the
support of the Better Scientific Software project ([BBSw](https://bssw.io/)).
The guides collect knowledge about managing the community around a scientific
software project and make this knowledge accessible to maintainers and
potential maintainers. The tutorials will teach this knowledge in small modules
that are accessible to scientists. Thus, if you are currently maintaining a
scientific software project, or think about starting one, we hope to have some
useful information for you.

We use a [questionnaire](modules/community_self_assessment.md) that helps us
investigate which policies make Sciencitific Software Communities more
successful. Answers from common projects will be included in the modules below,
but if you are interested feel free to read through them, and think about how
your own project addresses these challenges. We are also interested in getting
feedback about successful policies you have implemented in your projects.

## Current List of Modules

* [Engaging scientific users at project launch](modules/project_launch.md),
* [Integrating scientists uncomfortable with open-source software](modules/introducing_oss.md),
* [Balancing community and architecture work with scientific research](modules/balancing_software_science.md),
* [Combining high software quality with a welcoming atmosphere for diverse contributors](modules/balancing_quality_community.md),
* [Mediating between users working on conflicting features or overlapping publications](modules/mediating_conflicts.md),
* [Managing relations with competing projects](modules/managing_relations.md),
* [Providing fair credit and growth opportunities for contributors](modules/providing_credit_and_opportunities.md),
* [Managing changes in leadership, manage project forks](modules/managing_leadership.md)

## Who am I?

I am a maintainer of and contributor to open-source scientific software
projects for the majority of my (still short) scientific career. I am a
computational geophysicist by background, and I started as user, then
developer, then maintainer of a project called
[ASPECT](https://aspect.geodynamics.org) that models rock movements in the
solid Earth. I later started working for the [Computational Infrastructure for
Geodynamics](https://geodynamics.org), an organization commited to developing
and disseminating software for geophysics and related fields. Since then I have
worked on and provided guidance to several other software projects in the Earth
Sciences.  During my work on these projects and during conversations with
maintainers of other scientific software projects I have experienced that while
many projects employ state-of-the-art technical best practices, they often
struggle to create and maintain an active and welcoming community around their
software. 

As a BSSw Fellow, I want to develop a tutorial series that discusses the
typical social challenges that arise during the evolution of a scientific
software project. Aimed at current and prospective software maintainers and
community leaders, the tutorials will discuss topics such as building a
welcoming community atmosphere, overcoming skepticism of sharing science and
software, mediating between users working on conflicting topics or
publications, and providing credit and growth opportunities for contributors.

## Resources

Most of the modules contain some links to further reading specific to the questions that are addressed in that module. However, there are also excellent resources available that cover the open-source software (if not the science) side of this material. I highly recommend the following pages for further reading. Many parts of this website have highly benefited from these resources:

- [Producing Open Source Software](https://producingoss.com/)
- [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/)

## Code of conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in BSSC and our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone. Therefore we have adopted
a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) following the [Contributor Covenant
Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org). We expect members of our
community follow these guidelines to make sure we create a welcoming and open
environment for everybody.
