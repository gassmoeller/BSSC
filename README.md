# Better Scientific Software Communities (BSSC)

## What is BSSC?

BSSC is a series of guides / tutorial modules that are developed with the
support of the Better Scientific Software project (BBSw, https://bssw.io/). 
They collect knowledge about managing the community around a
scientific software project and make it accessible. 

## Who am I?

As a maintainer of and contributor to scientific software, I have experienced
that many scientific software projects employ state-of-the-art
technical best practices but struggle to create and maintain an active and
welcoming community around their software. As a BSSw Fellow, I want to develop a
tutorial series that discusses the typical social challenges that arise during
the evolution of a scientific software project. Aimed at current and
prospective software maintainers and community leaders, the tutorials will discuss
topics such as building a welcoming community atmosphere, overcoming skepticism
of sharing science and software, mediating between users working on conflicting
topics or publications, and providing credit and growth opportunities for
contributors.

## Planned subtopics

* Engaging scientific users at project launch,
* Integrating scientists uncomfortable with open-source software,
* Balancing community and architecture work with scientific research,
* Combining high software quality with a welcoming atmosphere for diverse
  contributors,
* Mediating between users working on conflicting features or overlapping
  publications,
* Managing relations with competing projects,
* Providing fair credit and growth opportunities for contributors.
* Managing changing and rotating leadership / maintainer roles, manage project forks
