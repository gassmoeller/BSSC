# Interview length ~30 min with 3-5 min per question -> 6-10 questions

## Questions:

0. (optional beginning) Please describe the nature of your software project. What is your type of project, do you develop application software or (generic or specific) libraries? How many users or developers are involved in your project?

1. (Project Activity) How active is the community in your software project? How many questions, comments, contributions do you typically get per week? How many new users or developers do you typically onboard per year? What is the preferred way of communication in your project?

2. (Types of Communication) Do your users/developer know or meet each other personally or does communication happen exclusively via mail/github/forum? If they meet, as part of a user or developer meeting, or typically as one-to-one meetings at conferences? How would you describe the general tone of discussion? Short or long? Unfriendly or welcoming?

3. (Code of Conduct and Atmosphere) Do you have an explicit or implicit code of conduct in your project? Does it need to be enforced? Did you have users complaining about the discussion culture in your project? How did you address these complaints?

4. (Identifying obstacles to new users) What is a common objection from potential new users in your project? If users decided not to use your project did you get feedback for what reason brought them to withdraw? Are all users comfortable with the level of openness that working with OSS brings with it?

5. (Planned project vs. chance) How did your project start? Was it launched as part of a larger initiative or was it something that happened by chance? Did it grow steadily or were there sudden periods of growth?

6. (Conflict management) Are you aware of situations in which participants worked on identical, or conflicting features for your software? When were these conflicts discovered? Do you have a certain policy to deal with these conflicts? Do you decide based on time of submission, technical quality, or social status of submitter?

7. (Financing and Time Balance) How is the work of your core developers financed? Do you get grants specific for software development? Do developers need to finance their own time (e.g. by taking time from their scientific proposals)? Do developers generally only work on topics they are personally invested in, or is there true community work happening? How much of it? Are there developers working exclusively on your software, or is it always connected and justified by science questions?

8. (Credit and Growth) How do contributions to your project get acknowledged? Is there a system for giving credit or even authorship to new contributors? Are these rules explicitly stated? Are these rules publicly available or only known for experienced contributors?

9. (Competing and Upstream Project Relations, this questions is sensitive, answering is optional, and you do not need to provide names)
  a. Does your project depend on scientific upstream packages (not general-purpose like MPI)? Is there communication between these projectes? Do you provide upstream improvements? 
  b. Are there competing software projects to yours with similar scope? How would you describe the atmosphere between your projects? Competitive? Collegial? Friendly?
